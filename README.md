# DBDiff
DBDiff is a tool that allows you to compare data in the database after some CRUD actions.

DBDiff supports these database adapters:
- mysql
- postgres

# Setup
  Clone dbdiff to your machine and run bundle install in Terminal
  ```
  bundle install
  ```

# Usage
  1. Go to the cloned folder in Terminal
  ```
  cd dbdiff
  ```

  2. Run the dbdiff in Terminal
  ```
  ruby dbdiff.rb
  ```

  3. When the Sinatra service is running, open the browser with the link:
  ```
  http://localhost:4567/setup
  ```

  4. Click **Add Connection** button to add database connection.

  Fill in the database connection detail and click **Add** button.
  The database connection will be added into config/databases.json

  5. Once the database connection is added, you can then go back to the [setup page](http://localhost:4567/setup) and select the "Database Name" that you want the data comparison and click **Compare** button to proceed.

  6. You can now view the data differences after some CRUD actions to the database.

  7. You can press refresh (command + R) or click **Compare** button again to compare the data continuously.

# How it works:
1. Everytime when you click the "**Compare**" button, it will write all the data from database into <.filenumber>.json file.

  The file number counter is stored in .filenumber, it is an auto generated number.

2.  DBdiff will always compares the last two <.filenumber>.json files (located in data/*.json folder) to generate the data differences result into data/diff.json.

  Example:
  ```
  write data into: <filenumber>.json
  compare: compare 1.json with 2.json
  then generate: diff.json
  ```

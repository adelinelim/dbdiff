# Usage

```
  2. Run the server_work

  3. When the Sinatra service is running, open the browser with the link:
```

```
  4. Click **Add Connection** button to add database connection.

  Fill in the database connection detail and click **Add** button.
  The database connection will be added into config/databases.json

  5. Once the database connection is added, you can then go back to the [setup page](http://localhost:4567/setup) and select the "Database Name" that you want the data comparison and click **Compare** button to proceed.

  6. You can now view the data differences after some CRUD actions to the database.

### Note:

  DBdiff will always compare the last two json files, located in data/*.json folder to generate the data differences result.
